# simon-css

This demonstrates the use of basic CSS for styling and a responsive design.

The addition of CSS makes our application visually appealing and adds intuitive user interface elements, but it is still not functional due to the lack of interactivity. We will add that in the next stage when we introduce JavaScript.

The application has a login (home), game play, high scores, and about page. Each page contains a header that provides navigation between the pages, and a footer that references the source repository. The bootstrap CSS framework is used for the navigation header.

You can view this application running here: [Example Simon CSS](https://simon-css.cs260.click)

## Study this code

Get familiar with what the example code teaches.

- Clone the repository to your development environment.

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-css.git
  ```

- Review the code and get comfortable with everything it represents.
- View the code in your browser by hosting it using the VSCode LiveServer extension.
- Make modifications to the code as desired. Experiment and see what happens.

## Make your own version

- Using VS Code, open the `simon` directory for the repository you used for the last Simon assignment.
- Modify the project to use CSS. Refer to the example class project repository for guidance. Remember that you do not need to recreate an original work. Just focus on learning the concepts that the example project provides. However, you will learn more if you type everything out, and not just copy and paste the code.
- Set the footer link to point to your code repository. (e.g. https://github.com/youraccount/simon)
- Periodically commit and push your code to your repository as you hit different milestones. (4 commits are required for full credit.)
- Periodically deploy to your production environment using a copy of the `deployFiles.sh` script found in the [example class project](https://github.com/webprogramming260/simon-css/blob/main/deployFiles.sh). Take some time to understand how it works. This is the same script that you used for the Simon HTML version.

  ```sh
  ./deployFiles.sh -k <yourpemkey> -h <yourdomain> -s simon-
  ```

  For example,

  ```sh
  ./deployFiles.sh -k ~/keys/production.pem -h yourdomain.click -s simon
  ```

- Update your `simon` repository README.md to record and reflect on what you learned.
- When you have completed your version. Do a final push of your code and deploy to your production environment using the `deployFiles.sh` script.
- Make sure your project is visible from your production environment (e.g. https://simon.yourdomain.click).
- Submit the URL to your production environment for grading using the Canvas assignment page.

## Grading Rubric
